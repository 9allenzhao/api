# Coins API Docs

This is an orphan branch that serves as a project page for Coins API. [Github Pages](https://help.github.com/categories/github-pages-basics/) is based from [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), which dictates the [directory structure](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/structure/) of this branch. Aside from that, we use [Flatdoc](http://ricostacruz.com/flatdoc) to generate pages from [Markdown](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown/)
